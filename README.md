Assignment 10 - Module 10 - sqlalchemy-challenge

#Overview:
I've decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with my trip planning, I decide to do a climate analysis about the area.

The Weather API is a Flask application that provides access to weather data from a SQLite database. It allows users to retrieve precipitation and temperature observations from various weather stations in Hawaii. This API offers endpoints for accessing recent weather data, including temperature observations for the most active stations over the past year.

## Structure:
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

1. SurfsUp/
* app.py: Main application file to run the Flask API.
- climate_starter.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for initial data exploration and analysis.

2. Resources/
* hawaii.sqlite: SQLite database containing weather data.
- hawaii_measurements.csv: CSV file with measurement data.
+ hawaii_stations.csv: CSV file with station information.

### Technologies Used:
* Flask: A web framework for building the API.
- SQLAlchemy: An ORM for interacting with the SQLite database.
+ SQLite: A lightweight database for storing weather data.
* Jupyter Notebook: An interactive environment for data exploration and analysis.
- Pandas: A data manipulation library for handling structured data.
+ Matplotlib: A plotting library for visualizing data.
